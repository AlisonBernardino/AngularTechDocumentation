                <article>
                    <p>
                        Angular is a popular JavaScript framework for building
                        dynamic web applications. It offers a powerful set of
                        tools and features, including component-based
                        architecture, data binding, routing, and dependency
                        injection. With Angular, developers can create scalable
                        and maintainable applications with ease.
